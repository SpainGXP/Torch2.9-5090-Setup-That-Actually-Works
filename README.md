# Torch2.9-5090-Setup-That-Actually-Works
This repo is not theoretical.   It exists because after fighting through dependency hell, mismatched wheels, broken builds, and pip silently replacing versions I never asked for, I finally landed on a setup that works. It works repeatedly, cleanly, and without pulling anything online once the wheels are in place.
